# Class 9 Reading Notes

## <i>HTML & CSS</i>
## Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)
- **Forms** When you take inputs from a user it is common to store them inside a form elemnt. Forms take data in key value pair format like variables.You can then manipulate the inputs from your form with javascript to perform a number of tasks. Forms are made up of a label element giving the input field a name and an input element that can be a checkbox or blank text filed and so on. The input element is where the user puts their information. The JS then uses a listener for an event like click or submit before performing the desired task with the information the user has input.

## Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)
- **Lists, tables and forms** Lists are a series of items. Tables hold inforatiom in rows and columbs with header and footer rows. Forms take information in key value pairs and store them until called upon. There are many ways to change the appearance of these objects. You can change the way a list behaves and where or not it has markers. You can even import a custom dot iamge for you unordered lists markers. Forms let you change the lable, increase the margins and padding on the input field. 

## <i>JavaScript & jQuery</i> 

## Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)
- **Events**  Events are how a browser communicates that something has happned like clicking the submit button on a form. Forms use event listeners to know when to act upon the input information. Binding allows us to use callback functions as if they had 'this' operators in them. The most common events are W3C DOM events. Events can be used to make your site more interactive. You can use javascript to make live changes to the HTML of your page when the user triggers an event.
