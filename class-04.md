# Class 4 Reading Notes
## <i>HTML & CSS</i>
## Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
- **Links:** Links are defined by the 'a' element and the href tags. Anything between an 'a' element can be clicked on by a user.
The text between the a tag is called a link and should describe where it will send the user. Absolute URLs are used to link to external sites. Relative URLs are used to link to pages within the same site and can be written short hand with just the file name and or directory if its not in the root folder. You can create links to open an email application with the 'to' autofilled using href=mailto. To open a link in a new window use the target=_"blank" attribute. To link to specific parts of the page you are on you need to assign id tags to the areas you want to navigate to user href=#nameOfId. You can also link to specific id attributes on external websites.
- **Directories:** For multi page websites its good practice to create separate folders for the different web pages on the site. The home page is the index.html in the root directory of the project. For child folders use the /folderName/site.html and for parent folders use ../site.html.

## Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
- **Block level elements** Block level elements start on a new line like building blocks, the following are block level: 'h1' 'p' 'ul' 'li' because when you add these to your code they separate themselves from each other and can be manipulated independently. You can put one block element inside another, parent to child.
- **Positioning** CSS lets you use the default flow, relative or absolute positioning. You can also float a given element. By default you blocks will run down the page with space between each other even if there is room for them to fit side by side. Relative lets you start at the normal position but then make adjustment up,down,left and right to move the block. Absolute take the element out of the flow and other elements ignore the space it would have taken up and overlap it as if it wasnt there. absolute will be scrolled away like default. fixed position elements do not move from the screen when the user scrolls, but also ignore flow. The z-index controls what element will appear over another when they overlap. The higher the z index value will always be on top. FLOAT takes an element out for the normal flow and lets you move it left or right and anything else in the containing element will flow around it. Float can be used to get paragraph or other elements side by side. The CLEAR property lets you say no element should touch left, right or both sides of any other elements appearing in the containing element. To CLEAR a single 'p' give it the id "clear" and assign clear left or right to it in css.
- **Screens** Screen size is the diagonal physical dimension of the screen on the device. This is a 13" macbook for example. Screen resolution is the X by Y grid of pixels in the screen. Typically declared by the y pixel count like 1080P is actualy 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels tall. Web sites are typically made 960-1000 pixels wide and put the most pertinent information in the top 570-600 pixels. Fixed width layouts chose a set width and don't change with the users screen size. Liquid layouts use %s to dictate the width of boxes so it will shrink and stretch based on the device. LIQUID should use min width and max width to put limits on the amount of stretching and shrinking your boxes do so they remain readable. GRIDS can be used to help make clean looking designs.
- ## <i>JavaScript & jQuery</i>
## Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)
- **Functions** Functions allow you to a series of tasks together to accomplish a goal. Functions can be used over and over in your code. We invoke a function to get it to accomplish its goal. Functions can take inputs and produce outputs. Variables declared inside a function won't be recognized globally.
## Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”
- 1. More effecient: Paired programming takes a little longer but produces higher quality code that needs less troubleshooting down the line.
- 2. More engaged: Less likely to get distracted when somone else is counting on you to get your work done. Also it is much easier to ask for help from a partner as they know exactly what you're working on and are vested in the result.
- 3. Learning from fellow students: Some may learn easier when the content is put into terms they understand. Also teaching a classmate solidifies the information in your mind.
- 4. Social skills: Forces you to work with somone who may think different than you or just not be that easy to get a long with. Honing this skkill will go a long way in any professional career.
- 5. Job interviews: You may be asked to do paired programming with a current employee. This shows the employer how good of a communicator you are as well as your coding skills.
- 6. Work environment: Employers expect to train you on how to work as a pair. You are one step ahead by chosing Code Fellows!
