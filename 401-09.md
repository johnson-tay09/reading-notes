# 401 Python Class 09 Reading Notes

## <i>Dunder Methods</i>
Dunder "__" methods are predefined methods for classes.
Use dunder methods to:
Initialization of new objects
Object representation
Enable iteration
Operator overloading (comparison)
Operator overloading (addition)
Method invocation
Context manager support (with statement)
Use dunder init in your class to constuct objects.
To provide string representation of objects in your class.
__repr_: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr_ is to be unambiguous.

__str_: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.
Iteration: __len_, __getitem_, __reversed_
Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: __eq_, __lt_
## <i>Statistics Porbability</i>
Change of a given outcome like a coin toss.
Event divided by the sample space
Simulate events to calculate probability in python.
normal distribution refers to a particularly important phenomenon in the realm of probability and statistics. The normal distribution is symmetrical in shape. 
Central Limit Theorem
If we make many estimates, the Central Limit Theorem dictates that the distribution of these estimates will look like a normal distribution. 
Three Sigma Rule
The Three Sigma rule dictates that given a normal distribution, 68% of your observations will fall between one standard deviation of the mean. 95% will fall within two, and 99.7% will fall within three. 
Z-score
It gains the most value when compared against a Z-table, which tabulates the cumulative probability of a standard normal distribution up until a given Z-score.
