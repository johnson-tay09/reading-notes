# 401 Python Class 29 Reading Notes

## <i>Django Custom User</i>
- for a real-world project, the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model instead.
- create and navigate into a dedicated directory called accounts for our code
- install Django
- make a new Django project called config
- make a new app accounts
- start the local web server
- Note that we did not run migrate to configure our database. It's important to wait until after we've created our new custom user model before doing so.
- AbstractBaseUser requires much, much more work.
- Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:
- update config/settings.py
- create a new CustomUser model
- create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
- update the admin
- Now that our custom user model is configured you can easily and at any time add additional fields to it. See the Django docs for further instructions.

- You can also check out DjangoX, which is an open-source Django starter framework that includes a custom user model, email/password by default instead of username/email/password, social authentication, and more.
