## <i>EJS Partials</i>

- Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.
- Like functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in.
- reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.
- Under the views/partials/ directory create a file called navbar.ejs which will contain only the HTML for the navigation bar at the top of the home and post pages
- In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimiters
- Including a partial in EJS is quite straightforward. You use <%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>
- As you can see creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS.
