## <i>Hash Tables</i>
- A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
-  A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
-  A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
-  Hold unique values, Dictionary, Library
-  Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.
-   A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.
-   Basically, a hash code turns a key into an integer.
-   The same key should always produce the same hash code.
-   A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array.
-   Collisions are solved by changing the initial state of the buckets. Instead of starting them all as null we can initialize a LinkedList in each one!
-   use methods add find contains and gethash
