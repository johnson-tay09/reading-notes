# 401 Python Class 31 Reading Notes

## <i>Docker</i>
- The entire development environment is isolated: programming language, software packages, databases, and more.
- What’s the downside? Complexity. Docker is a complex beast under the hood. 
- If you rent space on a cloud provider like AWS they are typically not providing you with a dedicated piece of hardware. Instead you are probably sharing a physical server with hundreds or even thousands of other clients.
- This, fundamentally, is what Docker is. A way to implement Linux containers!
- Virtual environments are used to isolate Python software packages locally.
- Also we can’t run a production database or other services within virtual environments so compared to Docker containers they are far more limited.
- Docker is a way to run Linux containers
- Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines
- Dockerfile is a list of instructions for creating an image
- Images are made up of one or more layers
- Containers are a running instance of an image
docker-compose.yml controls how to run the container
- Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesystem via volumes but things become more complex with databases (which we didn’t cover here).


## <i>Library Website and API</i>
- Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs.
- Django creates websites containing webpages, while Django REST Framework creates web APIs which are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs that return JSON.
- created a traditional Django Library website. Then we added Django REST Framework and were able to add an API endpoint with a minimal amount of code.
- Wow look at that! Django REST Framework provides this visualization by default. And there is a lot of functionality built into this page that we will explore throughout the book.
