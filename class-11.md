## Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)
- **Images** Always control the size of your images in CSS with width and height. Try to use one size through your site or just a few of the same sizes. The same goes for margin, define the small medium and big and stick to those sizes. You can make classes for image sizes and where they should align. An image can have more than one class so it is easier to have a small left img and a small right img but using multi classes. To center an image make its container block level and use margin auto left and right. Its best to make a center class if you plan to center multiple elements. Background images repeat by default unless you set them to no repeat. You can also set the to scoll with the user when they scroll down the page. If the background image isnt repeated you can use the background position property to move it around. Use a sprite for repeated images like buttonts to save load time.
