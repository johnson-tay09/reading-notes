## <i>Permissions & PGSQL</i>
- Together with authentication and throttling, permissions determine whether a request should be granted or denied access.
- Permission checks are always run at the very start of the view, before any other code is allowed to proceed.
- Permission checks will typically use the authentication information in the request.user and request.auth properties to determine if the incoming request should be permitted.
- Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.
- REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.
- Object level permissions are run by REST framework's generic views when .get_object() is called.
- The default permission policy may be set globally, using the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES setting.
- You can also set the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis, using the APIView class-based views.
- The AllowAny permission class will allow unrestricted access, regardless of if the request was authenticated or unauthenticated.
