## <i>EJS Normalize Data</i>

- Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.
- By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database. This eliminates some issues stemming from database modifications.
- minimize duplicate data
- avoid data modification issues
- simplify queries
- Duplicated information presents two problems: It increases storage and decrease performance. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.
- Deletion of a row causes removal of more than one set of facts.
- First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
- Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
- Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
