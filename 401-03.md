# 401 Python Class 03 Reading Notes

## <i>Read & Write Files</i>
A file is a contiguous set of stored data organized in a certain way. Files contain a header with metadata about the file. Files have path or the location of the file either locally or online. To open a file in python use the open() function that is built into python. Open functions are followed by a try block with code to process the file. Last there is a finally block to close the file with reader.close(). You can open a file as reading with 'r' or writing with 'w' or 'rb' or 'wb' for binary modes. Text files are the most common in python. 

## <i>Exceptions</i>
Exception errors occur when there is a problem with your code that isn't syntax. Exception errors show details of what the error is and where it is located in your code. You can create your own exception errors too. Assertions are like fail checks you can place in the middle of your program. Try except blocks can be used to catch and handle exceptions. The code will try the first block and if it fails it will run the except block. You can add an else block to the end for when there is no exception. You can add a finally block to the end that will always run.
