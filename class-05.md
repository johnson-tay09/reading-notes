# Class 5 Reading Notes
## <i>HTML & CSS</i>
## Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
- **Adding an image:** Images use the img tag to be called in html. These tags are self closing and must include an alt tag and a title tag. Alt tags describe the image for screen readers or if it doesnt load. Title tags show the title when the user floats their cursor over the image. It is best to include height and width when formatting your images so the browser knows how much space to leave for them while they load. 
- -**Formatting images:** We use jpeg format for photos and gif format for illustrations and logos. Images on your site should match your color pallet. It is important that you use relevant images becuase they are the first thing the use will see.
- 
- **Directories:** For multi page websites its good practice to create separate folders for the different web pages on the site. The home page is the index.html in the root directory of the project. For child folders use the /folderName/site.html and for parent folders use ../site.html.

## Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)
- **Specify colors** We can call colors with RGB values, HEX codes or by one of 147 predefined color names.
- **Color conventions** It is important to chose a background color with enough contrast for your text to be legible. You can change the opacity of an object with the opacity tag. If you use RGBA you can combine the color and opacity call in one where the last value is a decimal between 0 and 1. HSL stands for hue, saturation and lightness. Colors can enhance readability and set the tone of your website.

## Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)
- **Typeface** Attributes that affect text fall into two groups; some effec the font appearance and the others have the same effect on text no matter what font is used. Serif fonts havehave extra details on the ends of the letters. Sans-serif letters have straight ends. Monospace letters are all the same width (used for code). Browsers will only display fonts that are installed on the computer. In case the font you want isn't installed it is convention to call more than one font starting with your most prefered and ususaly ending with a generic font. 
- **Alternatives:** Font family requires the user's computer to have the font installed. Font face directs the users computer to download the font via CSS. A graphic containing the text you want shown can be used. SIFR replaces the text with a flash movie via JS. CUFON does the same but with SVG or VML instead of flash. Designers suggest not using more than three font types on a webpage. Font size can be declared in pixels, % or ems. The % size refers to the default size of 100%=16px. You can convert these to type scales in order to achieve a traditional look. @ font face lets you use a font not on the users machine by letting you specify a download path (src:url).
- **Other settings:** Font weight lets you make your font bold. font style italic lets you change your font to italic. Text-transform lets you set your font to all lowercase or uppercase or capitalize the first letter of each word. Text decoration lets you underline or remove underline on links by setting it to none: overline line through. Line height lets you increase or decrease the amount of space between each line in a multiline text element like P. Letter spacing does what it sounds like it does and so does word spacing. Text align lets you chose left, right, center or justify which calls for every line but the last line in a paragraph to take up the full box width. Vertical align is used with images to change where the text starts in reference to the img element next to it. Text indent and text shadow do what they sound like. You can use the first letter or first line attribute to embolden the first letter or line of a text element for effect. Link text can be altered with a: link or visited or hover or active to show the user a change.
