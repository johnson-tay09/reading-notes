# 401 Python Class 04 Reading Notes

## <i>Classes and Objects </i>
Objects in python have variable and function inside of them that can be called on using dot notation.
You can template your objects using Classes in python. Local object parameters with the same name will always override the ones inherited from the class.

## <i>Recursion</i>
For a function to be recursive it must call itself in its definition. They consist of a base case and the recursive case. The callstack is the result of the recursive part of the function being called over and over. The stack works from the top down, hence the name callstack.

## <i>Pytest Fixtures</i>
Fixtures are a way to share common data across multiple tests. Coverage is a measure of how well your tests are encompassing your code. Areas not tested will be shown by a coverage report.
