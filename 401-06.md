# 401 Python Class 06 Reading Notes

## <i>Random Module</i>
The random module lets us generate random numbers in python. Great for picking a random item from a list, simulating coin flips etc. Randint generate a random integer from two inputting a low and high int randint(0,100). Choice lets you generate a random selection from a list of elements. Shuffle takes a list and orders it randomly. Randrange takes a start stop and step and generates a random number within those parameters.

## <i>Risk Analysis</i>
Identify the risks in your code and prioritize testing them. Risk analysis is great for identifying the potential problems at the start of your software project. Possible risks: Use of new hardware
Use of new technology
Use of new automation tool
The sequence of code
Availability of test resources for the application.
Risk protocol: Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting

Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas

Create a Risk Assessment database for future use

Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.
High risk means the company might face loss
Medium risk can be tolerated but may cost the company money.
Low risk is tolerable with little consequence. 
Business risk, testing risk, premature release risk and software risk are the main types. Risk assessment: effect, cause and likelihood. Effect is the impact. Cause is the cause. Likelihood is the probability. 

## <i>Big O</i>
The carrier bird is constant time 0(1) because it doesn't change with the size of the data. When calculating O(n) you can drop constants like O(2n) would lose the 2. Same with O(n+N^2) where the n^2 ultimately out-scales the n being added to it so it can just be written n^2.
