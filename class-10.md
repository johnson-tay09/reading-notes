## JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”
- **Debugging:**  In javascript there are 7 different types of errors. They are denoted by the type of error, line it is one and a short description. It is key in debugging to figure out the order of execution of the script. This is easier to do on your own code but figuring out the sequnce the scrip is running will help locate errors. Javascrip seperates its environment into EC or execution content. This is the varaiables, objects and function JS has access to at a given time. In javascrip the stack is what we call it when JS needs to access data from another function before it can continue to the next line of code. The key to tourbleshooting then is to understand the sequence of the script and where in the stack your error might be.
