# 301 Class 13 Form Data

## <i>EJS Sending Form Data</i>

- Once the form data has been validated on the client-side, it is okay to submit the form.
- a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol.
- The server answers the request using the same protocol.
- The <form> element defines how the data will be sent.
- The two most important attributes are action and method.
- The action attribute defines where the data gets sent.
- The action value must be a valid relative or absolute URL.
- The method attribute defines how data is sent.
- the most common being the GET method and the POST method
- requests contain URL Header Body
- The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource."
- POST It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result."
- HTTP requests are never displayed to the user (if you want to see them, you need to use tools such as the Firefox Network Monitor or the Chrome Developer Tools).
- PHP offers some global objects to access the data. Assuming you've used the POST method, the following example just takes the data and displays it to the user.
