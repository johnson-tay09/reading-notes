## Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
- **Screens** Screen size is the diagonal physical dimension of the screen on the device. This is a 13" macbook for example. Screen resolution is the X by Y grid of pixels in the screen. Typically declared by the y pixel count like 1080P is actualy 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels tall. Web sites are typically made 960-1000 pixels wide and put the most pertinent information in the top 570-600 pixels. Fixed width layouts chose a set width and don't change with the users screen size. Liquid layouts use %s to dictate the width of boxes so it will shrink and stretch based on the device. LIQUID should use min width and max width to put limits on the amount of stretching and shrinking your boxes do so they remain readable. GRIDS can be used to help make clean looking designs.
- **Block level elements** Block level elements start on a new line like building blocks, the following are block level: 'h1' 'p' 'ul' 'li' because when you add these to your code they separate themselves from each other and can be manipulated independently. You can put one block element inside another, parent to child.
- **Positioning** CSS lets you use the default flow, relative or absolute positioning. You can also float a given element. By default you blocks will run down the page with space between each other even if there is room for them to fit side by side. Relative lets you start at the normal position but then make adjustment up,down,left and right to move the block. Absolute take the element out of the flow and other elements ignore the space it would have taken up and overlap it as if it wasnt there. absolute will be scrolled away like default. fixed position elements do not move from the screen when the user scrolls, but also ignore flow. The z-index controls what element will appear over another when they overlap. The higher the z index value will always be on top. FLOAT takes an element out for the normal flow and lets you move it left or right and anything else in the containing element will flow around it. Float can be used to get paragraph or other elements side by side. The CLEAR property lets you say no element should touch left, right or both sides of any other elements appearing in the containing element. To CLEAR a single 'p' give it the id "clear" and assign clear left or right to it in css.
