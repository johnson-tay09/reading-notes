## <i>Google Perfect Team</i>

People working in team innovate faster, find errors faster and report higher job satisfaction. Team work has boomed 50%. Google attempted to build the best team. They tried to figure out why some teams failed and others succeeded. In their research they found that there was no pattern as to who made up a successful team. Friends strangers none of it mattered. Group norms override individual preferences. Is there a collective IQ from a team.
The right team norms elevate a team IQ. Everyone speaks equally in strong teams. Social sensitivity is key too.
Teams need to feel like a safe place to speak your ideas and take risks! Psychological safety! Gotta have clear goals and a culture of dependability.
