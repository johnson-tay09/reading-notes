## <i>Node js</i>

- Node js is event based
- It is non blocking
- It is asynchronous
- It is a runtime that uses Google's V8 js engine - an open source js engine that rune in chrome based browsers. "...the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods."
- It uses libuv's library
- NPM is a package manager that comes installed with node
- node version manager lets you install multiple node versions at once and switch between them
- NPM is the worlds largest software registry
- common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.
- react, angualr etc are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.
- Node is used for running js on the server
- everything that happens in node is a reaction to an event
- node execution will process a request and produce a callback function when it encounters a blocking I/O and move on to the next request until the I/O operation is finished. (aka asynchronous)
- Node execution model scales by cloning the node app and having the clones share the workload
- Node runs in a single thread
- Node is suited apps that use real time interaction like a chat for example
- express is the best boilerplate framework
- node allows you to do everything in the same language server and client.
- node speaks json, which is the most important data exchange format on the web
