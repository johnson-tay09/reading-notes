# 401 Python Class 36 Reading Notes

## <i>Django Settings</i>
- Different environments. Usually, you have several environments: local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production, etc. 
- You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. On top of this there can be DB passwords and tokens for third-party APIs like Amazon or Twitter. This data cannot be stored in VCS.
- You need a general approach to eliminate human error when working with the settings.
- This is a curse and a blessing at the same time. It gives you a lot of flexibility, but can also be a problem – instead of key-value pairs, settings.py can have a very tricky logic.
- There is no built-in universal way to configure Django settings without hardcoding them. But books, open-source and work projects provide a lot of recommendations and approaches on how to do it best. 
- This is an extension of the previous approach. It allows you to keep all configurations in VCS and to share default settings between developers.
- The Settings file is a small but very important part of any Django project. If you do it wrong, you’ll have a lot of issues during all phases of development. But if you do it right, it will be a good basis for your project that will allow it to grow and scale in the future.
- Using the environment variables approach, you can easily switch from a monolith to microservice architecture, wrap your project in Docker containers, and deploy it in any VPS or Cloud hosting platform such as: Amazon, Google Cloud, or your own Kubernetes cluster.




## <i>SSH</i>
- SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet. 
- The service was created as a secure replacement for the unencrypted Telnet and uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted manner.
- It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.
- The SSH key command instructs your system that you want to open an encrypted Secure Shell Connection.
- The significant advantage offered by SSH over its predecessors is the use of encryption to ensure secure transfer of information between the host and the client
- Host refers to the remote server you are trying to access, while the client is the computer you are using to access the host. There are three different encryption technologies used by SSH:
- Gaining an in-depth understanding of the underlying how SSH works can help users understand the security aspects of this technology. Most people consider this process to be extremely complex and un-understandable, but it is much simpler than most people think. If you’re wondering how long it takes for a computer to calculate a hash and authenticate a user, well, it happens in less than a second. In fact, the maximum amount of time is spent in transferring data across the Internet.
- Hopefully, this SSH tutorial has helped you see the way different technologies can be clubbed together to create a robust system in which each mechanism has a very important role to play. Also, now you know why Telnet became a thing of the past as soon as SSH came up.
