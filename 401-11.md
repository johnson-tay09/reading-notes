# 401 Python Class 11 Reading Notes

## <i>JupyterLab</i>
- You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters
- JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats. See File and Output Formats for more information.
- To navigate the user interface, JupyterLab offers customizable keyboard shortcuts and the ability to use key maps from vim, emacs, and Sublime Text in the text editor.
- JupyterLab extensions can customize or enhance any part of JupyterLab, including new themes, file editors, and custom components.
- JupyterLab is served from the same server and uses the same notebook document format as the classic Jupyter Notebook.


## <i>Numpy</i>
- NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package.
- By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric.
- Each row after the header row represents a wine. The first element of each row is the fixed acidity, the second is the volatile acidity, and so on. 
- With NumPy, we work with multidimensional arrays. We’ll dive into all of the possible types of multidimensional arrays later on, but for now, we’ll focus on 2-dimensional arrays.
- We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function. If we pass in a list of lists, it will automatically create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns.
- It’s possible to use NumPy to directly read csv or other files into arrays.
- We now know how to create arrays, but unless we can retrieve results from them, there isn’t a lot we can do with NumPy.
