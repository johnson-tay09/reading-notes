# 401 Python Class 42 Reading Notes

- Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
- You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

- Below, we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a <li> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems:

- This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.

- Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. Let’s see how this works in action.

- In this section, we will create a temperature calculator that calculates whether the water would boil at a given temperature.

- React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.

- In this section, we will consider a few problems where developers new to React often reach for inheritance, and show how we can solve them with composition.

- Containment
Some components don’t know their children ahead of time. This is especially common for components like Sidebar or Dialog that represent generic “boxes”.

- We recommend that such components use the special children prop to pass children elements directly into their output:
- React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.

- One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this document, we’ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.
