# 301 Class 09 Refactoring

## <i>Functional Programming in JS</i>

- Immutability and pure function. build side-effect-free functions
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects
- Is repeatable
- mutability is discouraged in functional programming.
- Easier to test
- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.
- With recursion, we keep our variables immutable. The list and the accumulator variables are not changed. It keeps the same value.
- toLowerCase: converts the string to all lower case
- trim: removes whitespace from both ends of a string
- split and join: replaces all instances of match with replacement in a given string
- pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
- Functions as first-class entities can:
- refer to it from constants and variables
- pass it as a parameter to other functions
- return it as result from other functions
- When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:
- takes one or more functions as arguments, or
- returns a function as its result
- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.

### <i>Refactoring JS</i>

- There's a middle ground between speed and comprehension and that's where good code lives.
- For those examples, we assumed that the random function wouldn't clash. 'Cloning TinyURL' is a common system design question and a very interesting one at that. What if the random function does clash? It's easy to tack on addendums about scaling and redundancy.
- We separated some logic and reduced the number of lines of code. We inlined a function called pick that accepts an array of length 1 and up and returns a random choice, then we used a template literal to build an URL.
- Write your code right the first time
- Hard to get a chance to refactor
