## <i>Intro to Next.js</i>
- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.

- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.

- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.

- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.
