### <i>Select queries</i>

- Retrieve data from a SQL database
- A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned
- The columns would then represent the common properties shared by all instances
- "\*" can retrieve all the columns. This is used to inspect the data
- SELECT "what you want" FROM "name of table"
- WHERE set condition for checking each row of data for specific column values
- Can use and or greater than etc on WHERE
- run faster due to the reduction in unnecessary data being returned.
- WHERE supports case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching
- Since the DISTINCT keyword will blindly remove duplicate rows, we will learn in a future lesson how to discard duplicates based on specific columns using grouping and the GROUP BY clause.
