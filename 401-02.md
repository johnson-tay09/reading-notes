## <i>In Tests We Trust</i>
Test let you check that your code is outputting what you expect. Write tests first (TDD) in order to brainstorm your problem solving process. If you write tests first it also ensures you actually write the tests. Forces you to break apart the problem in to smaller testable parts. The cycle is to write a failing test, make it pass and then refactor. Rinse and repeat.

## <i>Recursion</i>
When a function has the capacity to call itself and rerun. Recursive functions must have a base case that can be met so that it does not go infinite and cause a stack overflow error. Recursive functions are a compact way to write things that could be written with iterative functions.
