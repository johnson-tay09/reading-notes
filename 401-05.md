## <i>Linked Lists</i>
A new data structure where each element is contained in a node. Single linked: Only goes in one direction and  holds the current node value and the next node address. Double linked: Can go two directions and carry the same as single but also carry the address of the previous node. Head: the first node in the linked list.

## <i>Linked Lists? P1</i>
Linked lists are a way to organize data. Linked lists are linear data structures(order to their construction and traversal). Linked lists don't use a single block of memory but can be scattered throughout the memory. Linked lists are dynamic data structures which can shrink and grow in memory and doesn't need a set amount of memory allocated in order to exist. Linked list starting point is called Head and is required to know where to start. The end of a list is a node that points to null or an empty value. 

## <i>Linked Lists? P2</i>
When to use linked lists is the most complex part. Big O-how much time it takes an algorithm to run and how much memory it needs as the input value approaches infinity or how quickly its runtime will grow. Linked lists wont run out of space like a pre-allocated array.  First, we find the head node of the linked list. Next, we’ll make our new node, and set its pointer to the current first node of the list. Lastly, we rearrange our head node’s pointer to point at our new node. Adding an element to the list takes the same amount of time no matter how large the list is.Find the node we want to change the pointer of (in this case, the last node).
Create the new node we want to insert and set its pointer (in this case, to null). Direct the preceding node’s pointer to our new node. "a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element." Don't use linked lists if you requires a lot of traversal, iteration, or quick index-level access (use an array instead).
