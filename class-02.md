# Class 2 Reading Notes
## <i>HTML & CSS</i>
## Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)
- **Headings:** There are 6 different headings available in HTML labeled h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. The h1 tag is for the main heading and all other tags are for subheadings.
- **Elements:** There are many HTML elements that are used to describe the structure of a web page. These include p for paragraph, b for bold text  and i for italics.
- **Semantic markup:** HTML elements can also be used to add semantic information like where emphasis should be placed.

## Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)
- **What CSS does** CSS allows us to control the appearance of our website. Including but not limited to colors, margins and line spacing.
- **How CSS works** CSS treats each HTML element separately unless told to do otherwise. CSS 'cascades' therefore the same element can have multiple rules applied to it but only the rule closed to the end of the page will be executed. More specific rule call outs can overwrite global ones and defeat the cascading behavior.
- **CSS rules** Rules are made with selectors to specify which element to change followed by declarations that indicate what the element should look like. CSS rules are stored in a separate .css document and linked in the HTML page by convention.
## <i>JavaScript & jQuery</i>
## Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)
- **What is a script?** A script is a series of instruction executed in order like the steps of a recipe. JavaScript can store bits of data in variables to be used later. Variables should help describe the information being stored in them but there are a short list of reserved words not allowed to be used as variables.
- **JavaScript basics** Arrays are variables that can store more than one piece of related information. JavaScript uses text known as 'strings', boolean values of true or false and numbers 0-9. 

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
- **Conditional statements:** Allow your code to decide what to do next based on the result of statement. Results are determined by the use of comparison operators like greater than or less than. If x then y, if x or y, then z are examples of conditional statements. The else if statement is also useful for having more branches on your decision tree.
- **Switch statements** Let us compare a value with any number of possible results. 
- **Loops** For, while and do are the three different types of loops. While loops let you repeat a section of code until the conditional statement changes from true to false. For loops let you apply code to multiple parts of the data set that meet condition. Do loops are like while loops but they execute the block of code once before checking the conditional statement and repeating or exiting the loop.
