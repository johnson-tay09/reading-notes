# Class 7 Reading Notes

## <i>Domain Modeling</i> 
Domain modeling creates a model of the problem and can be like proof of concept showing you know how to solve the problem.
Most commonly we use self contained objects with the same attributes and methods. It is most effecient to use a constructor function so you can make new objects and easily change existsing ones. Start small and focus on methods that work well before moving to the next part. The keywork 'new' lets you create new instances of objects with your constructor function. We store those instances in a varaiable likely an array and then call upon that variable in our methods to access the properties inside our object instances.
## <i>HTML & CSS</i>
## Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)
- **What is a table:** Tables represent information in a grid format. The table element creates a table. The tr element creates a table row and is followed by one or more td elements. The td element represents a table data cell. The th element is like a td but is meant to represent the heading. Use colspan="#" to have a td span more than one column and rowspan for rows. Long tables use thead tbody tfoot to seperate formatting for the table.

## <i>JavaScript & jQuery</i>
## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)
- **Functoins:** Function allow you to group a set of operations to complete your goal. Functions can be fed parameters. Functions can return outputs. Functions cannot be called until they are declared. Function cannot be declared until they are written so oder matters. In constructor notation we state the object.name of the function followed by a : and the word function(){}. For variable we will call over and over its best to declare them globally instead of inside a method.
- **Objects:** Objects are models of things in the real world. An object can have any number of variables and functions inside it. For objects we call variables Parameters and we call functions Methods. A web browser uses objects to represent the node layout of the web page and the actual document it renders. JS has build in objets like Math and String. The built in objects have methods developers can use to help write scripts. Arrays can be insite objects and objects inside arrays.
