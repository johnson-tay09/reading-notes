## <i>Responsive Web Design</i>

Responsive web design is intended to make web pages user friendly for mobile and desktop users. The three main parts are flexible layouts, media queries and flexible media. Flexible layouts are built with a dynamic grid that can resize height, width, margin and padding. These are built with units in relative length like % or ems. No fixed lengths so instead take the target length and divide it by the parent length to get the ratio. You can use the min/max-width/height to control your elements too. Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances. To initiate use the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet to avoid any additional HTTP requests.There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only. Mobile first uses smaller sizes as default and only calls media queries when the viewport grows in order to make mobile browsing faster. Use viewport and device-width/height to inherit the width of the mobile device. Flexible media allows images and videos to scale too.

## <i>Floats</i>

Floated elements remain part of the flow of the web page. Absolute elements are removed from the document flow. You can float left, right, none or inherit. Clear removes float. If this parent element contained nothing but floated elements, the height of it would literally collapse to nothing. Use empty div method to separate floated elements. You can use the overflow method on the parent to expand it to contain the floats. Alternatives for float include flexbox and grid but for wrapping text float is still key.
