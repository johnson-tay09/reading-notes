# Class 14 Reading Notes

## Google Team
People working in team innovate faster, find errors faster and report higher job satisfaction. Team work has boomed 50%. Google attempted to build the best team. They tried to figure out why some teams failed and others succeded. In their research they found that there was no pattern as to who made up a successful team. Friends strangers none of it mattered. Group norms overide individual prefernces. Is there a collective IQ from a team.
The right team norms elevate a team IQ. Everyone speaks equally in strong teams. Social sensitivity is key too.
Teams need to feel like a safe place to speak your ideas and take risks! Psychological safety! Gotta have clear goals and a culute of dependability. 

## Transforms
A way to position an eliment. There are 2d and 3d transforms. Transform property you want followed by its value. Like transform: scale(1.5). 2D tranforsm work on the x and y axis while 3d transforms add the z axis. Rotate can take positive or negaitce degrees. Scale changes size: less than 1 shrings and more than 1.0 grows. You scale just x or y if you want. Translate changes the position in x or y. The skew value distorts an axis. To combine transforms list the transform values one after another without commas. transform: skew(20deg) scalex(1.5) etc
You can change where the transform animation starts using the transform-origin property. Use persepctive for 3d.

## Transitions
Transitions let you alter the appearance of an effect when the event occurs. Like hovering over a box to change the color. You can set a duration and timing. Translation-property let you decide which property wil change when you transition like border-radious or color or size. You can do more than one. You can also more than one duration to match the multiple translation properties and have them go differetn durations! Transition timing changes the speed of the transition, like linear or ease in or ease out. you can add a delay with transition delay. 

You can use Keyframes to set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition. Keyframes give you more explicit control over your transitions. You call a % complete and what to do in the keyframe.  Animation-name to assign an animation to an element. The CSS ssimple 8 transitions are really slick.
