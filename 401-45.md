## <i>Intro to Graphs</i>
- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
- An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
- Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.
- A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
- A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
- A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
- An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.
- A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
- A directed acyclic graph is also called a DAG. This can also be represented as what we know as a tree.
- A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

- A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix
- An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs. An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.
- A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.
- You will be required to traverse through a graph. The traversals itself are like those of trees. Below is a breakdown of how you would traverse a graph.
