## <i>List Comprehensions</i>
List comprehensions are a way to create new list based on arguments applied to old lists. They use [ ] to help you remember they return a list. new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]. Expression to apply to instances in the old list. You can use range to produce a list based off of an expression being applied to a range of numbers. new_range = [i * i for i in range(5) if i % 2 == 0]
